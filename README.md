## About Who Would Win:
Welcome to "Who Would Win"! This is a fun application where you can see your wildest character brawl scenarios come to life! Got a favorite movie, video game, TV show, or novel character in mind? Submit them to our database and have them enter the arena. Want to see what we have to offer? Feel free to click the "Play Now" button and participate in the action. In our game room you'll be able to see randomly-generated matchups of characters from your favorite franchises. There, you can vote on who you think would win in an epic (or even hysterical) battle of the ages! Cast your vote and see how others have voted too, and have a great time!


## To use the site itself:
Simply visit our website at https://who-would-win-eosin.vercel.app/
Here you have the option of scrolling down and submitting a character in our form. Characters in our database are based off of their franchise and name (with an img URL as well). If you try to submit any character with the same name and franchise, they won't be accepted. Image URLs must be between 250 x 250 and 1250 x 1250. This is done to preserve the scaling of images in our arena. After you've submitted as many characters as you like, enter the arena by clicking "Play Now". There, you will see randomly-generated matchups of characters. Here you can vote on who you think would win in a match, and see how your votes contribute to the overall vote count(s) of your matchups. There will be nC2 possible matches, where n represents the total number of characters in our database. Watch random matchups form and have fun voting! If you'd like to go back to the home page, click the blue back button on the top left of the screen. There you can either submit more characters, view some additional information about our project, and access these sections using our navigation. Enjoy!

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
